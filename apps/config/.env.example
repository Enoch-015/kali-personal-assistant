# ============================
# Python Services Configuration
# ============================
# Copy this file to .env in the apps/config directory.
# These values are shared between AI and Voice services.
#
# IMPORTANT: In production, all sensitive values (database URIs, API keys)
# should come from Vault, not from this file. The values below are only
# used as fallbacks when Vault is not available.

# ============================
# Vault Configuration
# ============================
# Default to localhost for local development.
# Docker containers receive VAULT_ADDR via docker-compose.yaml
VAULT_ADDR="http://127.0.0.1:8200"

# ============================
# Service-Specific Credentials
# ============================
# For LOCAL DEVELOPMENT:
#   Each service uses prefixed env vars for its Vault credentials.
#   Copy values from .vault-credentials.env (generated by setup-vault.sh)
#
# For DOCKER:
#   docker-compose.yaml maps the prefixed vars to VAULT_ROLE_ID/SECRET_ID
#   for each container automatically.

# For AI service running locally (apps/ai)
# PYTHON_AI_VAULT_ROLE_ID="<from .vault-credentials.env>"
# PYTHON_AI_VAULT_SECRET_ID="<from .vault-credentials.env>"

# For Voice service running locally (apps/voice)
# LIVEKIT_VAULT_ROLE_ID="<from .vault-credentials.env>"
# LIVEKIT_VAULT_SECRET_ID="<from .vault-credentials.env>"

# ============================
# Fallback Settings (only used if Vault unavailable)
# ============================
# In production, these come from Vault's "databases" secret path.
# These defaults are only for local development without Vault.
